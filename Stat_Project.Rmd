## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Libraries

library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
# Load the dataset

hotel_bookings <- read.csv("hotel_bookings.csv", na.strings="NULL")
View(hotel_bookings)
```


```{r}
# First look to the dataset

str(hotel_bookings) # check the data type of each column

```



```{r}
# Convert character columns into factors

hotel_bookings_new <- as.data.frame(unclass(hotel_bookings),
                       stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```
