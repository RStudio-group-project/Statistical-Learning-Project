# Statistical Learning project: Hotel booking demand

This is an exam project of Statistical Learning made by /m-pernini, /ir-ca and /ChiaraDelu. 
We decided to analyze the Hotel booking demand dataset that we load from Kaggle. This dataset contains
information about two different kinds of hotel: City Hotel and Resort Hotel. Each observation represents
an hotel booking. Both hotels are located in Portugal: the resort hotel at the resort region of Algarve and
the city hotel at the city of Lisbon.
The aim of the project is to assess if it is possible, starting from the information provided by the booking
dataset, to predict how likely is that a customer who booked a room will cancel the reservation. This can
allow an hotel to plan how many staff are needed, how much food to buy, or, more in general, if it is worth
(and to what extent) to engage in overselling in order to fill all available rooms. To achieve this result a
prior explanatory analysis is required.
Most of the work deals with analysis and detailed description of the main features with respect to the variable
“is_canceled”, but we decided at the beginning to take a more general look on the whole set of data, in
order to have a broader view of the main informations provided by the dataset.
We used R as programming language.
